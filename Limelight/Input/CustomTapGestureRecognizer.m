// The most accurate & reliable tap gesture recognizer of iOS:
// - Almost 100% recoginition rate. UITapGestureRecognizer of Apple API fails frequently, just a piece of crap.
// - When immediateTriggering is set to false (for native multi-touch):
//   Gesture signal will be triggered on touchesEnded stage, multi finger touch operations will not be interrupted by the arising keyboard.
//   Instances of different [numberOfTouchesRequired] barely compete with each other, for example, the chance of 3-finger gesture get triggered by 4 or 5 finger tap is very small.
// - Set property immediateTriggering to true, to ensure the priority of keyboard toggle in non-native touch mode, in compete with 2-finger gestures.
// - This recognizer also provides properties like gestureCapturedTime, to be accessed outside the class for useful purpose.
